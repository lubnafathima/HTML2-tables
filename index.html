          In 2003, <a href="">Dave Shea</a> began a legendary project called
          <a href="">CSS Zen Garden</a>
          that provided a demonstration of "what can be accomplished through
          CSS-based design" until submissions stopped in 2013.

          <b>Style Stage</b> seeks to rekindle that spirit by providing this
          page as the base HTML for contributors - like you! - to re-style by
          submitting an alternate stylesheet.
        </td>
        <td colspan="2">
          <b>How it works:</b> Visit the <a href="">"All Styles"</a> directory
          page and select a style to view. A page with identical content to this
          one will be presented with a new design provided from a contributed
          stylesheet. CSS practitioners of any skill level are invited to
          <a href="">submit a stylesheet</a>!
        </td>
        <td colspan="4">
          The HTML for this page was created to be semantic, accessible, and
          free of nearly all other opinions. Nested sectioning elements with the
          class `.container` serve as additional style aids since you do not
          have access to alter the base HTML. IDs are included where needed for
          nav anchors or accessibility, and a small number of additional classes
          are provided for key elements without IDs. Don't forget the
          `.skip-link`!

          All submissions will be autoprefixed and prepended with the
          <a href="">CC BY-NC-SA license</a> as well as attribution using the
          metadata you provide. You may use any build setup you prefer, but the
          final submission should be the compiled, unminified CSS. You retain
          the copyright to original graphics and must ensure all graphics used
          are appropriately licensed. All asset links, including fonts, must be
          absolute to external resources. Stylesheets will be saved into the
          Github repo, and detected changes that violate the guidelines are
          cause for removal.
        </td>
        <td colspan="4">
          Ensure your design is responsive, and that it passes accessible
          contrast (we'll be using aXe to verify). Animations should be removed
          via `prefers-reduced-motion`. Cutting-edge techniques should come with
          a fallback if needed to not severely impact the user experience. No
          content may be permanently hidden, and hidden items must come with an
          accessible viewing technique. Page load time should not exceed 3
          seconds.
